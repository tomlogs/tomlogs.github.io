Welcome to my personal blog, TomLogs! I will be sharing posts about my technical learnings, and logging my progress in my side projects. I plan to post regularly (at least that's the goal!).

I'm most interested in web development, so stay tuned if that is your interest. I hope you can extract some value from my posts.

I highly value your feedback, please message me on Twitter if you have anything to say! Looking forward to hearing from you. Enjoy the logs!
