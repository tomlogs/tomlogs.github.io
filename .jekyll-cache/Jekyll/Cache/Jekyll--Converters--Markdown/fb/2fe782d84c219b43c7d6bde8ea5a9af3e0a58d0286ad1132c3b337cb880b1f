I"é<p>Welcome to my personal blog, TomLogs! I will be sharing posts about my technical learnings, and logging my progress in my side projects. I plan to post regularly (at least thatâ€™s the goal!).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m most interested in web development, so stay tuned if that is your interest. I hope you can extract some value from my posts.</p>

<p>I highly value your feedback, please message me on Twitter if you have anything to say! Looking forward to hearing from you. Enjoy the logs!</p>
