I"j<p>Welcome to my personal blog, TomLogs! I will be sharing posts about my technical learnings, and logging my progress in my side projects. I plan to post regularly (at least that’s the goal!). I’m most interested in web development, so stay tuned if that is you interest. I hope you can extract some nugget of value from my writings, whatever the size.</p>
